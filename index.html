				Moss Quest is a magical-realist, text based, adventure game created by <a href="aboutartists.html">Sophie Griswold and Owen Payette McGarry.</a>  You play as a destitute farmer who travels to the town of Mossfell on the Keller Penninsula, desperately seeking moss cultivars with which to diversify the failing moss monocrop on your barren island croft.  By doing so, you will provide a sustainable foodsource for your flock of sheep, and save your ailing mother Gurtha. <br><br>
				
				Moss Quest has recently been acknowledged by the United Nations Environmental Council. <br><br>
				
				Will be released for OS X and Windows later this year.
